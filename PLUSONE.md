  # PLUSONE 


  ## Description 

A web application created for users looking to meet new friends or dates to attend local events with. Here, users (for example user A) can view local events or create an event of their own and other users who are also interested in the same event as user A, can request to attend the event with user A. When the users sign up to attend the event, they can enter their contact information and then sign up. Then a link to the event will be generated and saved to their profile so they can later view the event details as needed. If user A and another user (for example user B) decide to attend the event together, user A can review both the event and user B after the event. If user B would like to respond to the review, they are also able to do so. The website is open to both users looking for date related
