  # Employee_Directory 


  ## Description 

The Employee Directory is an application that displays a list of employees' information and permits the user to search on any field displayed (first/last name, address, city, state, phone number). The user is also able to click any of the column names in the employee directory and the table is sorted in ascending or descending order by that column name. Click the same column name again reverses the sort order. The employee directory is refreshed with a new list of employees every time the page is reloaded. As the user types a search term and the list is filtered, clicking a column name will sort the resulting data set. The employee data is retrieved from a 3rd party API (RANDOMUSER.ME)
